# Pitcher Report Builder App ⚾️

This Streamlit application takes csv files from specific pitch tracking software and generates a downloadable png that contains a variety of metrics detailing performance broken down by pitch. It is a visualization tool that can be utilized by both coaches and players alike to analyze performance from both bullpens and live sessions. The application was developed as a means to make data more accessible to individuals invested in both player and team performance.
